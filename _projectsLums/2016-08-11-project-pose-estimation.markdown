description: Through the fusion of only two pose detectors and an articulated skeleton tracker we were able to enable view-invariance. The equipment used was a Microsoft Kinect and a DSLR camera. We used the depth sensor from the Kinect camera to track the skeleton and used the color sensor from the Kinect along with the DSLR camera to detect the poses. Using the equipment we were able to overcome some limitations of current 2D human pose estimation techniques and were able to increase precision.
